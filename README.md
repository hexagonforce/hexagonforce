Hi! I am Hyeong Seon Yoo (유형선). I studied my bachelors in Computer Science in Ateneo de Manila University.

My primary interests are mobile networking, software-defined networks, algorithms, linguistics and teaching coding to students.

I also like tinkering with various Linux setups (Neovim, SwayWM, waybar, etc.)
